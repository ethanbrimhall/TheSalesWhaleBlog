          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">When it comes to sales, we've already seen AI replace basic jobs in retail and fast food. But by 2020, a million B2B salespeople will lose their jobs, according to Forrester. Will this have a more direct impact to the sales reps overloaded with busy work, sales reps with poor closing tech, or sales reps loaded up with cold calling?<br><br>The old-world, high-pressure gimmick loaded sales techniques are gone.   What got you here won’t get you there. To make it clear, sales reps must evolve. <b>Here are several approaches to help you stay <b>relevant.</b></b></p>

          <h3 id="Blog-Sub-Title">The Expert with a Human Touch</h3>
          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Customers will start the buying based on emotion.  You want someone who you can trust, who understands you and your business, and your pain points and understands the product to solve those things. <br><br>Be likeable and trustworthy, you can’t manufacture that like a robot. Be the customer advocate and support the buying process, don't try to control it.  This will never change.</p>
          <br>

          <h3 id="Blog-Sub-Title">Transform into a Digital Salesforce</h3>
          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Consumers are now so knowledgeable and empowered that two-thirds consult social media before making a buying decision. Buyers are no longer restricted to the information available in a brochure or sales prospectus. They have a wealth of information at their fingertips online from their mobile devices including product details and specifications, company background, and peer reviews.  Are you utilizing digital presentations that are customized to their needs.  How is your skype presentation these days?</p>
          <br>

          <h3 id="Blog-Sub-Title">Digital Selling vs. Cold Calling</h3>
          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Build your pipeline by social planning and networking. Use LinkedIn for prospecting. How would you grade your digital brand these days? DS allows salespeople to learn about their prospects using social networks, and apply this learning to their sales pitches. <br><br>The biggest difference between social selling and traditional sales techniques is that while the latter focuses mainly on short-term sales results; social selling is more about building long lasting relationships.  90% of decision makers said they “never” respond to cold calls! To put this into perspective, you would need to make more than 1,600 calls to generate 5 sales meetings.</p>

          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Ask yourself if what you are doing today is getting you closer to where you want to be tomorrow?</p>
