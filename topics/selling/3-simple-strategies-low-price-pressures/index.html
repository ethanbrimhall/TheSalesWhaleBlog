          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">If your business strategy is the famous “low price guarantee”, then you might want to start adjusting the approach a bit. We have seen recently with Payless shoes, being the low-price focus company.   Pricing pressures can be foiled if we have a simple strategy.   <br><br>If I ask most businesspeople what to do if your clothes catch on fire, everyone would say, “Stop, Drop, and Roll.” If I asked for the three things you should do when you face pricing pressure, your team might stop what they are doing, drop your price, and roll over. This means that most sales professionals are better prepared for the unlikely event of catching on fire than they are prepared to deal with pricing pressure.</p>

          <h3 id="Blog-Sub-Title">Be value based</h3>
          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Help the prospect discover the solution to his/her need or problem and immediately recognize a benefit from using your product or service. By thinking of the presentation as a road map and questions as signposts or direction markers, a salesperson directs the prospect into discovering a solution to his need or problem. The ultimate destination on this journey is to create a happy and satisfied customer and to get the order.</p>
          <br>

          <h3 id="Blog-Sub-Title">Use a Price Structure to Clarify Your Advantage</h3>
          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Call attention to the value your product or service delivers, and ideally to the one dimension that most meaningfully differentiates it from those of competitors.  Constant price undercutting can damage brand equity and erode profit margins. Meanwhile, customers develop low expectations and become disengaged.   We begin with the idea of revisiting pricing structure because it is so often neglected. When managers worry about pricing, they typically focus on determining the optimal price point for a given product. Drawing on market testing or research techniques ranging from simple surveys to full-scale conjoint analyses, they work diligently to discover just how much demand would be generated at different prices under different support conditions.</p>

          <h3 id="Blog-Sub-Title">Equalize Price Points to Crystallize Personal Relevance</h3>
          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Proving options and bundling.  Asking customers to choose among several options designed to appeal to different tastes. Research suggests that in such cases all the variants should be priced the same, because customers will then be compelled to discover which option best suits their needs. They will work to fully appreciate the range of options a seller is offering, not to find ways to shed features for a lower purchase price.</p>
          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">This is an atypical approach to pricing customizable offerings. Usually, different prices are set for the different options on offer. A beverage company, for example, would price fruit smoothies higher if they were made from exotic fruits such as mango and papaya rather than from apples and pears. The same principle applies to milk, whose price typically varies depending on the fat content. This makes sense to companies that believe in cost-plus pricing, because different product options often involve different production costs: If the goal is to maintain a constant profit margin on items sold, the company must charge different prices.</p>
