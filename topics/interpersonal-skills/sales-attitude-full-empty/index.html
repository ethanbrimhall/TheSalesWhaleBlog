          <h3 id="Blog-Sub-Title">Every situation is a learning moment</h3>
          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Losing an opportunity never feels good, but sales makes you better at it. You'll primarily talk to people who tell you no, so you learn not to take it personally. The thing to realize is that when someone tells you no, they aren't saying no to you, they're saying no to the idea. Letting things go and learning how to handle rejection will give you the mentality to persevere in any situation.<br><br> Sales is a numbers game. You have to put yourself out there again and again. The best way to improve is to fail. You'll learn from your mistakes and become better. In sales, becoming better means closing more deals. All it takes it consistency. The best salespeople have been rejected countless times, but they never gave up.   Learn, grow and celebrate your steps forward.</p>
          <br>

          <h3 id="Blog-Sub-Title">Positive Posture</h3>
          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">The mind and the body have an intrinsic connection—each has an impact on the other. If you are struggling to move your mind into a more positive perspective, try moving your body there first. Try standing up straight, shoulders back, chin held high, stretching your arms out as wide as they can go. Feel powerful. Feel positive. Carrying yourself with “positive posture” will encourage your mind to feel more positive as well.</p>
          <br>

          <h3 id="Blog-Sub-Title">Your Health</h3>
          <p id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">You become what you eat and think about all day long.   To be the best at your game you need to take care of yourself mentally and especially physically.  If your health fails, it can overshadow everything else that’s going on in your life.    I know you have heard this before but it's time to make it real.</p>

            <li id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Find a fitness habit that is tailored to you.</li>
            <li id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Watch your intakes:  nicotine, excess alcohol, and even excessive caffeine can take a toll on your health in the long run, but also make you feel lousy overall in your day-to-day life.</li>
            <li id="Blog-Paragraph" class="lead">Take breaks.   You're working your tail off.     Have pause moments to turn everything off and enjoy the quiet.  take a walk or enjoy some music.   Have a work/life balance. If you're regularly burning the candle at both ends, you'll eventually burn out.</li>
